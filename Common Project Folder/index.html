        <img alt ="With beef and cheese aside, they decorate the crunchwrap supreme with healthy vegetables to balance out the oilyness of the meat. They add diced tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream and melted cheese. All of the flavors go so well together and bursting with flavor.">

        <img alt="Taco Bell has an iconic fold especially for the crunchwrap supreme. It stands out from any other taco created by them and as well as any other mexican place. Who would've thought to create such a meal by folding a quesadilla into a pentagon shape?">

        <img alt="What makes this dish more iconic than it already is is how they grill it. They don't deep fry it or oven bake it except they pan fry it. They panfry the crunchwrap supreme until it gets golden cripsy brown.">
